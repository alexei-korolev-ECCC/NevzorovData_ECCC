# NevzorovData_ECCC

The in-situ data were collected by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) in collaboration with the National Research Council (NRC) on the NRC Convair-580 research aircraft equipped by: the Nevzorov probe (Korolev et al. 1998), Rosemount Icing Detector (Baumgardner and Rodi, 1989; Mazin et al. 2001), Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe (FSSP) (Knollenberg, 1976, McFarquhar et al, 2017), Optical Array Probe 2DC (OAP-2DC) (Knollenberg, 1976; Baumgardner et al., 2017), and Optical Array Probe 2DP (OAP-2DP) (Knollenberg, 1976).
The methodology of Nevzorov probe data processing and phase discrimination was described in detail in (Korolev et al. 1998; Korolev and Strapp, 2002). The Nevzorov probe liquid water sensor measurements were corrected on the residual effect of ice (Korolev et al. 1998, 2003; Field et al., 2004) and the total water sensor measurements were corrected on the ice bouncing effect (Korolev et al. 2013). The Rosemount Icing Detector was used to identify the presence of the liquid phase and exclude false liquid signals in ice clouds. The FSSP was employed to identify the presence of liquid droplets smaller than 45 um in diameter. The OAP-2DC and 2DP were used for justification of the presence or absence of ice particles based on identification of non-circular shapes of their binary images. 
The thresholds for liquid water content and ice water content (IWC) were set as LWC > 0.01g m-3, IWC > 0.01g m-3, respectively. The phase composition of clouds was identified based on the assessment of the ice water fraction μ=IWC/(LWC+IWC). Thus, clouds with μ> 0.9 were considered as ice, clouds with μ< 0.1 were defined as liquid, and clouds 0.1 ≤μ≤ 0.9 were determined as mixed-phase clouds. 

The airborne data was collected during seven fiel campaigns
